 * Dice Tower.
 * A Dice Tower is a tool used by serious gamers use to roll many dice at once.
 * It looks like this:
 * https://www.miniaturescenery.com/Images/PortableDiceTowerLarge.jpg
 * An instance of a dice tower is defined by the number panels it
 * contains to help provide a more regular distribution of die values.
 * The die bounce from panel to panel until they
 * exit the dice tower at the bottom tray.
 * A dice tower will accept a collection of dice and reports their results when
 * they reach the tray at the bottom
